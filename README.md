# App Ideas From Group 33:
## Favorite Apps:

1. Snapchat (Categories: Social Media, Video/Photo sharing)
2. YouTube (Social Media, Entertainment, TV, Music)
3. Lime.S (Transportation, Social Media)
4. Spotify (Music, Social Media)
5. Venmo (Productivity, Money/Finances, Lifestyle)

## Problems:
1. Sometimes we want to have some animals to hang out with us when we're sad. Let's create an app that brings animals to your door. (let's call it 'DogDash')
2. An app that takes items from multiple online stores (Amazon, Ebay, etc...) and puts them all in a care package for you.
3. Safety app that sends the user data of crimes and other questionable activity based on current location (a location based app that lets you know if you're approaching or are in a potentially dangerous area).
4. An app/extension that lets you filter through item types, color, fit, style, etc...
5. An app that informs you if an item is about to spoil (you enter an item into the app as soon as you buy it, and it takes note of the expiration date). 
6. Idea from app 5 can have a feature that advises you to buy more of a certain food that just ran out/went bad.
7. Randomizer/style guide for clothing.Basically, enter your wardrobe into the app, and the app will create a outfit for you, or there is a style expert on the line to assist you.
8. Recipie app that takes into consideration all of the ingredients/food you have at home, and filters through online recipies to find one that matches yout list of ingredients. Also, it has an option to have the app learn what your tastes are and tailor your results based on that. App can also filter through types of cusine (Mexican, Any type of Asian food, etc...)
9. Haircut app that takes into consideration your gender, face shape, head shape, hair type, and picks a haircut for you based on the type of look you are going for (user can use keywords like 'short', 'modern', 'sporty', 'trendy', etc...). Also shows 360 models of people with a selected haircut (or yourself, Augmented Reality).
10. Android widget that can delete all emails except the ones you starred.
11. App that generates a budget based on how much money you have, and your income. Notifies you if you are spending too much (customizable).
